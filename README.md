This project was created for the ASABE AIM digital agriculture hackathon 2023 by Cheyenne Simmons, Juliet Norton, Autumn Denny, Maggie Barnes, and Tiffany Coogle.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to produce a soil moisture logging system with both a hardware and software component. The hardware was created using an R3 Uno Elegoo, an ESP32, and a few Songhe capacitive soil moisture sensors. The web dashboard was developed with PHP, CSS, and HTML and is supported on the backend by MySQL and FastAPI.
